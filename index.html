                        <p>The ability to anticipate future needs is an essential ingredient of successful executive decision making. Recently, RS2 helped a government costumer visualize their future needs by supporting a tabletop simulation for them in Frederick, Maryland. For the simulation, RS2 used hypothetical situations to develop a scenario which enabled the customer to think through what might be their technology needs in the year 2030. Over sixty representatives from the military services, interagency, academia and the private sector participated in the simulation which applied a wide range of facilitation and Red Teaming techniques to get the most out of the everyone who attended.</p>
