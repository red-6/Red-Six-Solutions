                        <p>On 4 September, the Red Team traveled to nearby Caroline County, Virginia, to support a technical assessment of a Counter–UAS System being developed by Blind Tiger Communications of Atlanta, Georgia. At a rural test site, Red Six flew live-simulations using commercial drones representative of current threat actors. It was a great day for flying and an ideal environment for supporting Blind Tiger’s R&D objectives.    </p>

Approximately forty-four diplomatic personnel and military officers from NATO, Mediterranean Dialogue, Istanbul Cooperation Initiative and Partners across the Globe countries participated in the three-day exercise. Pictured are Scott Crino, CEO, Red Six, and Emily Estelle of the American Enterprise Institute during one of the group sussions. Emily, along with Fiona Barsoum of the European University Institute provided subject matter expertise to facilitate group dialogue throughout the event.

                        <p> Butlerville, IN: Red Six Solutions was proud to support the U.S. Army at a recent Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) assessment at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center located in southern Indiana (25 – 29 July 2016). The purpose of the assessment was to help provide the Army insights into how threats to our military might employ Small-UAS in urban environments. An article written by the Army Press is available

                        <p>The ability to anticipate future needs is an essential ingredient of successful executive decision making. Recently, RS2 helped a government customer visualize their future needs by supporting a tabletop simulation for them in Frederick, Maryland. For the simulation, RS2 used hypothetical situations to develop a scenario which enabled the customer to think through what might be their technology needs in the year 2030. Over sixty representatives from the military services, interagency, academia and the private sector participated in the simulation which applied a wide range of facilitation and Red Teaming techniques to get the most out of the everyone who attended.</p>
